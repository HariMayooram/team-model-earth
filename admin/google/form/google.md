# Google Sheets API

Yes, this is definitely possible using the Google Sheets API combined with proper authentication and access control. Here are the main approaches:

## Using Google Sheets API with Row-Level Access Control

**Core Components:**
- **Google Sheets API** for reading/writing sheet data
- **Google Apps Script** or your own backend service for access control logic
- **User authentication** (Google OAuth or your own system)

## Implementation Approaches

**Option 1: Server-Side Filtering**
- Your application authenticates users and maintains a mapping of users to their allowed rows
- Use the Sheets API to read the entire sheet, filter rows on your server based on user permissions
- Only allow edits to rows the user owns through your API endpoints
- Write changes back to the sheet via the API

**Option 2: Google Apps Script with Custom Functions**
- Create Apps Script functions that enforce row-level permissions
- Deploy as a web app that users interact with instead of direct sheet access
- Script checks user identity against row ownership before allowing edits
- Can create custom UI or use HTML service for the interface

**Option 3: Multiple Sheets with Sharing**
- Create separate sheets or tabs for different users
- Use Google's built-in sharing permissions to control access
- Less flexible but simpler to implement

## Key Technical Considerations

**Authentication:** You'll need to handle user authentication and map authenticated users to their permitted rows (perhaps via an email column or user ID field).

**API Permissions:** Your application needs appropriate OAuth scopes like `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/spreadsheets` for read/write access.

**Row Identification:** You'll need a reliable way to identify which rows belong to which users - typically a column containing user emails, IDs, or other identifiers.

The server-side filtering approach gives you the most control and security, while Google Apps Script can be simpler for straightforward use cases. Would you like me to elaborate on any of these approaches or help you think through the specific requirements for your use case?
